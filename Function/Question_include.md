Q1. Design a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. You could define default values 
for the width and the height but still allow the caller to provide different values when needed. 


Q2. Raising a number n to a power p is the same as multiplying n by itself p times. Write a 
function called power() that takes a double value for n and an int value for p, and returns the 
result as a double value. Use a default argument of 2 for p, so that if this argument is omitted, 
the number n will be squared. Write a main() function that gets values from the user to test this 
function. 


Q3. Write a program to define function cube() as inline for calculating cube. 


Q4. Write a program that will overload a function Volume() to compute following operations: 
1. A cube (side) 
2. A cuboid (length, breadth, height) 
3. A sphere (radius)

5. CurrentCGPA 
Member Function(behavior):
