Problem Q2. 
-
Raising a number n to a power p is the same as multiplying n by itself p times. Write a 
function called power() that takes a double value for n and an int value for p, and returns the 
result as a double value. Use a default argument of 2 for p, so that if this argument is omitted, 
the number n will be squared. Write a main() function that gets values from the user to test this 
function.
