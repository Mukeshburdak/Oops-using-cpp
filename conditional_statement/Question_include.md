Problem 1:  
In today’s digital world, secure passwords are essential to protect sensitive data. Weak passwords (like 
only numbers or only alphabets) are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. A password checker is required 
to verify the strength of a password based on its composition. 
The program should read a password from the user and analyze its characters using a for loop. It must 
count uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Based on these counts, the 
program will determine if the password is Weak, Moderate, or Strong. 
Objectives: 
• To use a for loop to traverse each character of the password string. 
• To check and classify characters into: 
• Uppercase letters (A–Z) 
• Lowercase letters (a–z) 
• Digits (0–9) 
• Special characters (@, #, $, %, !, etc.) 
• To decide password strength based on composition rules. 
• To demonstrate practical use of loops in real-world cybersecurity applications. 
Password Strength Rules: 
➢ Weak: 
• Length < 6 OR contains only one type of character (e.g., only digits). 
➢ Moderate: 
• Length ≥ 6 AND contains at least two types of characters (e.g., letters + digits). 
➢ Strong: 
• Length ≥ 8 AND contains all four types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special). 
Expected Outcome: 
➢ Program should count and display character categories. 
➢ Based on rules, display the password’s strength. 
➢ Should handle different test cases (weak, moderate, strong). 
Sample Input/Output 
Input: 
Enter password: abcd123 
Output: 
Uppercase Letters: 0 
Lowercase Letters: 4 
Digits: 3 
Special Characters: 0 
Password Strength: Moderate 


Problem 2: 
In real-world e-commerce or retail billing systems, customers purchase multiple items in a single 
transaction. The system must accept item prices one by one, calculate the total bill, and apply 
discounts if applicable. To simulate this scenario, we design a C++ program that repeatedly accepts 
item prices until the customer finishes shopping. 
The loop should continue asking for prices until the user enters 0, which indicates checkout. Using 
break and continue statements ensures flexible control of the loop, similar to real-world billing 
systems. 
Objectives: 
➢ To simulate a shopping cart system where multiple item prices are entered. 
➢ To use a for/while loop to repeatedly accept item prices. 
➢ To apply: 
o continue → skip invalid entries (like negative prices). 
o break → stop when user enters 0 (checkout). 
➢ To calculate the total bill and apply discounts if total exceeds a threshold. 
Discount Rule: 
• If total bill > ₹5000, apply 10% discount. 
• Otherwise, no discount. 
Expected Outcome: 
• Program should allow the user to keep adding item prices. 
• Negative prices should be ignored with a warning. 
• Entering 0 should stop input and calculate the final bill. 
• If applicable, discount should be applied automatically. 
Sample Input/Output 
Input/Run: 
Enter item price (0 to checkout): 1200 
Enter item price (0 to checkout): 1500 
Enter item price (0 to checkout): -50 
Invalid price! Skipped. 
Enter item price (0 to checkout): 3000 
Enter item price (0 to checkout): 0 
Output: 
Total Bill (before discount): ₹5700 
Discount Applied: ₹570 
Final Bill: ₹5130 


Problem 3: 
In real-world traffic management, signals are crucial to ensure road safety and regulate the flow of 
vehicles. Drivers must respond appropriately to the traffic light color. The problem is to design a 
program in C++ that simulates a traffic signal and provides instructions to the driver based on the signal 
color entered. 
Objective: 
• To develop a C++ program that takes the traffic signal color (Red, Yellow, or Green) as 
input. 
• To implement decision control statements (if, else-if, else) for decision-making. 
• To display the corresponding driving instruction: 
➢ Red → Stop 
➢ Yellow → Get Ready 
➢ Green → Go 
• To handle invalid input using proper validation. 
Expected Outcome: 
• The program should correctly identify the input signal color and display the respective 
driving instruction. 
• If the input is invalid (not Red, Yellow, or Green), the program should display an error 
message. 
• The output should simulate a real-world traffic light system by guiding the driver’s 
action. 
Sample Input/Output 
Input: 
Enter traffic light color: Red 
Output: 
Stop! 
Input: 
Enter traffic light color: Green 
Output: 
Go!  
Input: 
Enter traffic light color: Blue 
Output: 
Invalid input
