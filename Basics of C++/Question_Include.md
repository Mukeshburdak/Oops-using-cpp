Problem 1. 
-
Write a program (WAP) to display "Hello World" on console display. WAP to 
implement the following control characters: 

‘\n’ is for new line, or you can use endl – cout<<endl<<“message”; 
‘\t’ is for tab ; ‘\a’ is an alarm sound; ‘\r’ is carriage return to go to the beginning of  
the current line

Problem 2. 
-
Write a C++ program that will ask for a temperature in Celsius and display it in 
degree Fahrenheit.[F=9C/5+32] 

---
Problem 3.
-
WAP to calculate gross salary of a person, where gross_salary = basic+da+ta+HRA and 
da is 46% of basic and ta is 8% of basic and HRA is 9% of basic pay.

Problem 4. 
-
A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions:  

(i) Hardness must be greater than 50  

(ii) Carbon content must be less than 0.7  

(iii) Tensile strength must be greater than 5600 

The grades are as follows:  

Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met  

Grade is 9 if all conditions (i) and (ii) are met  

Grade is 8 if all conditions (ii) and (iii) are met  

Grade is 7 if all conditions (i) and (iii) are met  

Grade is 6 if only one condition is met  

Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met  

Write a program, which will require the user to give values of hardness, 
carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under consideration and 
output the grade of the steel. (Solve using nested if-else, ladder if and else 
if)

Problem 5. 
-
A library charges a fine for every book return late. For first 5 days the 
fine is 50 paisa, for 6-10 days fine is one rupee and above 10 days fine is 
5 rupees. If you return the book after 30 days your membership will be 
cancelled. WAP to accept no. of days the member is late to return the 
book and display the fine or appropriate message. 

---
Problem 6. 
-
WAP to demonstrate for, while, do-while (with all possible variations), like for loop 
can be demonstrated without giving initialization in for construct or without giving 
increment in for construct.  

Sample: 

for (int i=0; i<10; i++) 

i=0 

for (; i<10; i++) 

i=0 

for (; i<10;) 

i++

Problem 7.
-
Implement namespace in a program to illustrate the use of same name variables and 
functions in different sections/libraries of the code. 

---
Problem 8. 
-
Create a structure in C++ containing the details of Students as details below and a 
main function to execute the structure.  

Data Members(properties): 

Name 

Roll No 

Degree 

Hostel 

CurrentCGPA 

Member Function(behavior): 

addDetails(); 

updateDetails(); 

updateCGPA(); 

updateResidenceInfo(); 

displaydetails();

Problem 9. 
-
Differentiate between private and public access/scope. Perform the question no. 5 
with structure having the data member in private scope. Students should be able to  

a) differentiate between structure  in C vs structure in C++ 

---
Problem 10. 
-
Create a code snippet that illustrates the following: 

a. Calling of private member functions inside public member function 

b. Access private member functions inside public member function 

---
Problem 11. 
-
An election is contested by five candidates. The candidates are numbered 1 to 5 and 
the voting is done by marking the candidate number on the ballot paper. Write a 
program to read the ballots and count the votes cast for each candidate using an array 
variable count. In case, a number read is outside the range 1 to 5, the ballot should be 
considered as a ‘spoilt ballot’, and the program should also count the number of spoilt 
ballots. 

---
Problem 12. 
-
Write programs to evaluate the following functions to 0.0001% accuracy. 

(a) sinx = x - (x^3)/3! + (x^5)/5! - (x^7)/7! +.........

(b) SUM  = 1 + (1/2)^2 + (1/3)^3 + (1/4)^4 +...........

(c) cosx = 1 - (x^2)/2! + (x^4)/4! - (x^6)/6! +..........

---
Problem 13.  
-
An electricity board charges the following rates to domestic users to discourage large 
consumption of energy: 

For the first 100 units 

60P per unit 

For next 200 units 

80P per unit 

Beyond 300 units 

90P per unit 

All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 50.00. If the total amount is more than Rs. 
300.00 then an additional surcharge of 15% is added. Write a program to read the 
names of users and number of units consumed and print out the charges with names.
